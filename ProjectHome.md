This project provides the plumbing required for a custom YouTube AS3 player implementation. It offers a convenient wrapper on top of the YouTube Flash Player [API](http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/flash_api_reference.html) so that the developer can take advantage of syntax checking and code completion features of her favorite IDE. Additionally, the process of loading the YouTube player library, handling resizing events, etc. is taken care of by the wrapper.
There are a couple of usage examples provided with the wrapper:
  * Chromeless player
  * Embedded player
  * Simple mashup player
More examples are on the way!

Follow [these](http://code.google.com/p/youtube-as3-player-helper/wiki/HowToBuildProject) instructions to build the project.
